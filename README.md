# PPOL564FinalProject

Hello! This is the digital home of my final project for Data Sciences I: Foundations at the McCourt School for Public Policy. The goal of this project is to 
explore in-school suspsension data across the state of Tennessee in anticipation of the enforcement of the Teacher Discipline Act. 

The data used in this project is publicly available here: https://www.tn.gov/education/data/data-downloads.html and is produced by the Tennessee
Department of Education. In order to account for the discrepancies of data reporting during the COVID-19 pandemic, only data from the 2018-2019 school 
year was used.
